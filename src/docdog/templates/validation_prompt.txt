Please review the README you've just generated and validate it against these criteria:

1. Does it include all required sections from the initial instructions?
2. Is the information accurate based on the project files you analyzed? You must be confident in the content.
3. Is it well-formatted and readable?
4. Are there any sections that could be improved with the information available?

If the README needs improvements, provide an improved version starting with 'Improved README:'.
If the README is satisfactory, respond with 'README validation passed: [brief summary of what you included]'
