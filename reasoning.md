# Reasoning Behind README Generation

**Title and Badges**:
- The project name "DocDog" is taken from the `pyproject.toml` file.
- The license badge is added based on the Apache 2.0 license found in the `License` file.

**Overview/Introduction**:
- The overview section provides a concise explanation of what DocDog does, based on the project's core functionality of generating README documentation for software projects by analyzing the codebase.
- The problem it solves (streamlining documentation process) and the motivation behind it (saving time and effort while ensuring accurate documentation) are inferred from the project's purpose.

**Features**:
- The features section lists the core features of DocDog, based on the functionality implemented in the `main.py`, `chunking.py`, and `mcp_tools.py` modules.
- Details like code analysis, parallel processing, and template support are derived from the code and associated comments/docstrings.

**Installation**:
- The installation instructions are based on the standard Python package installation process, assuming DocDog is a Python package.

**Quick Start Guide**:
- The quick start guide provides a simple command (`docdog`) to generate the README, as evident from the `main.py` module and the usage examples in the code.

**Usage**:
- The usage section includes the command-line arguments and options available for DocDog, as implemented in the `main.py` module and the argument parsing code.

**API Documentation**:
- The API documentation section documents the core classes and functions in the project, such as `MCPTools`, `chunk_project`, and other utility modules like `sanitize_prompt`.
- The documentation is based on the code structure, function signatures, and docstrings/comments found in the respective modules.

**Configuration**:
- The configuration section explains the environment variables and command-line arguments that can be used to configure DocDog, based on the code in `main.py` and the available options.

**Examples and Use Cases**:
- The examples and use cases section provides realistic code examples and common usage patterns for DocDog, based on the usage instructions and command-line arguments implemented in the codebase.

**Troubleshooting/FAQ**:
- The troubleshooting section addresses common issues that may arise during the usage of DocDog, such as missing API keys or incomplete documentation generation.
- These issues are inferred from the code logic and potential error scenarios.

**Contributing**:
- The contributing section provides basic guidelines for contributors, as is common practice in open-source projects.

**License**:
- The license section specifies the Apache 2.0 license, as found in the `License` file in the project.
