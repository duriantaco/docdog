## Overview/Introduction

DocDog is a command-line tool that automates the generation of comprehensive documentation for software projects. It leverages AI models from Anthropic to analyze and summarize code, and generates a professional README file based on the generated summaries. The tool aims to streamline the documentation process and enhance developer productivity.

## Features

- Chunks project files into multiple text files for efficient processing
- Summarizes code chunks using the Anthropic AI API
- Generates a professional README file with various sections
- Supports parallel processing for faster code summarization
- Provides configuration options for customizing tool behavior
- Utilizes caching to improve performance for repeated summarization tasks
- Integrates with the PyKomodo library for efficient chunking (if available)

## Installation

```bash
pip install docdog
```

Make sure to have the required dependencies installed (`anthropic`, `python-dotenv`, `pykomodo`, `tiktoken`, and `jinja2`).

## Usage

```
docdog [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-p PROMPT_TEMPLATE] [-m MODEL] [-k API_KEY] [--reasoning] [--max-iterations MAX_ITERATIONS]
```

- `-o`, `--output`: Specify the output file for the generated README (default: `README.md`)
- `-p`, `--prompt-template`: Path to a custom prompt template file
- `-m`, `--model`: Model to use for summarization (default: `gpt-4o-mini`)
- `-k`, `--api-key`: API key for the selected model (if not set in the environment variable)
- `--reasoning`: Generate a `reasoning.md` file explaining the AI's decisions
- `--max-iterations`: Maximum number of iterations for analyzing project chunks (default: 15)

To use DocDog, navigate to your project's root directory and run the `docdog` command. The tool will automatically chunk the project files, summarize the code chunks, and generate a README file based on the summaries and other project information.

## Configuration

DocDog can be configured via environment variables and a `config.json` file in the project root. The following options are available:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (environment variable): Your API key for accessing the Anthropic models.
- `num_chunks` (config.json): The number of chunks to split the project files into (default: 5).
- `model` (config.json): The model to use for summarization (default: `gpt-4o-mini`).
- `max_tokens` (config.json): The maximum number of tokens for the generated summaries (default: 5000).
- `temperature` (config.json): The temperature value for the model (default: 0.7).
- `verbose` (config.json): Whether to enable verbose logging (default: false).
- `allowed_extensions` (config.json): An array of file extensions to include in the chunking process.

## Examples and Use Cases

Here's an example of how to use DocDog to generate a README for a Python project:

```bash
# Set the API key (Anthropic)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Navigate to the project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run DocDog
docdog
```

This will generate a `README.md` file in the project root directory, containing sections like Overview, Features, Installation, Usage, API Documentation, Configuration, Examples, Troubleshooting, Contributing, and License.

You can also customize the output file name and specify a custom prompt template:

```bash
docdog -o my_project_readme.md -p custom_prompt.txt
```

## Troubleshooting/FAQ

**Q: I'm getting an error about the API key.**
A: Make sure you have set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable with a valid API key. You can also pass the API key directly using the `-k` or `--api-key` option.

**Q: The generated README is missing some sections or information.**
A: DocDog generates the README based on the information available in the project files and configurations. If certain information is not found or cannot be inferred, the corresponding sections may be incomplete or missing.

**Q: Can I customize the README structure or sections?**
A: Currently, DocDog uses a predefined structure for the README file. However, you can create a custom prompt template and provide it using the `-p` or `--prompt-template` option.
