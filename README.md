# DocDog - Automated Documentation Generation for Code Projects

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/yourusername/docdog)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/yourusername/docdog)

## Overview

DocDog is a powerful AI-based tool designed to streamline the process of generating documentation for code projects. It leverages the OpenAI API to analyze and summarize code, automatically creating comprehensive README files. This tool aims to enhance developer productivity by reducing the time and effort required for documentation, allowing teams to focus on coding while maintaining high-quality documentation.

## Features

- **Project Chunking**: DocDog can chunk a project's code files into manageable pieces, optimized for processing by large language models (LLMs).
- **Code Summarization**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate concise and informative summaries for code chunks, functions, and classes.
- **README Generation**: Generates a professional README.md file based on the code summaries, project structure, and configuration files.
- **Parallel Processing**: Supports parallel processing of code chunks for faster summarization, leveraging multiple CPU cores for improved performance.
- **Caching**: Implements caching mechanisms to avoid redundant summarization of previously processed code, improving efficiency.
- **Configurable**: Offers a range of configuration options to customize the behavior of the tool, such as the number of chunks, allowed file extensions, and model parameters.

## Installation

```bash
pip install docdog
```

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including `openai`, `python-dotenv`, and `pykomodo`.

## Usage

1. Navigate to your project's root directory.
2. Run the `docdog` command with the desired options:

```
docdog --output README.md
```

This will generate a `README.md` file in the current directory, containing the project's documentation based on the code summaries.

For more advanced usage and configuration options, refer to the [documentation](link-to-documentation).

## Configuration

DocDog supports various configuration options to customize its behavior. You can create a `config.json` file in the project root directory with the following structure:

```json
{
    "num_chunks": 5,
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "max_tokens": 5000,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "verbose": false,
    "allowed_extensions": [".txt", ".md", ".py", ".pdf", ".sh", ".json", "..."]
}
```

- `num_chunks`: The number of chunks to split the project files into (default: 5).
- `model`: The OpenAI model to use for code summarization (default: "gpt-3.5-turbo").
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens for the summary (default: 5000).
- `temperature`: The temperature parameter for the language model, controlling the randomness of the output (default: 0.7).
- `verbose`: Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes (default: false).
- `allowed_extensions`: A list of file extensions to include in the chunking process (default: common code and documentation file types).

## Examples and Use Cases

DocDog can be beneficial in various scenarios, including:

- **Open-Source Projects**: Maintain up-to-date and comprehensive documentation for your open-source projects, making it easier for contributors to understand and collaborate.
- **Internal Projects**: Streamline documentation within your organization, ensuring consistent and accurate information across different teams and projects.
- **Personal Projects**: Automatically generate documentation for your personal projects, saving time and effort.

## Troubleshooting/FAQ

**Q: How can I ensure the accuracy of the generated documentation?**
A: While DocDog aims to provide accurate summaries, it's always recommended to review the generated documentation and make necessary adjustments based on your project's specifics.

**Q: Can I customize the structure and content of the generated README?**
A: Yes, DocDog supports customization through templates and configuration files. You can modify the structure, add additional sections, or adjust the content based on your project's needs.

**Q: Does DocDog support multiple programming languages?**
A: Yes, DocDog can process various programming languages by default, including Python, JavaScript, Java, and more. You can also extend the supported file types by modifying the `allowed_extensions` configuration option.
